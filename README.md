# DODM-Final-Project
Final project for the Discrete Optimisation and Decision Making course (Master's degree in Data Science)

work on run_scenario file, I hope that I have started to layout a format we can all work to - Fabio

m.getConstrs() - Retrieve a list of all linear constraints in the model.

Additional Question for Proff:
1. How should we test such a complicated model?
2. What is the requirement for visualsiation of the model?
3. This project is already massive, is there an understanding of limiting the required work?
4. I assume we dont have to inforce the requirement that no bus route will travel down the same arc (I believe this will be enforced by the inputs provided)
5. Are we right in thinking that bus routes dont loop back on themselves

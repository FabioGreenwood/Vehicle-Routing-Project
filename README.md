# Vehicle-Routing-Project
This was the final project for the discrete optimisation and decision making module of my master's degree in data science

## DESCRIPTION
This project was to use decrete mathamatics to define a vehicle routing problem. This was mainly my own work.

The repository contains:
-  The documentation can be found in the pdf document called DODM Project Documentation. The document contains the mathematical model definition, assumptions and a theorical metaheuristic adaptation of the problem.

- The python files to run the program
    * function to import the problem inputs -> import_function.py
    * model implementation -> run_scenario.py
    * over arching method to solves the problem -> main.py
    * incomplete visualisation tool -> Resources\visualisation methods.py

## DEPENDENCIES
- A Gourobi license
- The installation of following libraries: sys, math, random, itertools, os, datetime, pathlib gourobipy, numpy.lib, pandas, numpy, copy, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.gridspec, pickle
- The model was created to work with an older version of python (likely 3.9)
